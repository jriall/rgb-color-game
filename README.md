# RGB Colour Picker

A game to test a users knowledge of colour codes and improve their colour selection skills. The game displays to the user a selection of randomly generated colour tiles, alongside a single colour code, and asks the user to select the correct tile. Users can play the game on easy or hard mode (3 or 6 tiles), as well as having the ability to have the code displayed in either hexidecimal or RGB code.
